    "title": "Pentest: What is it?",
    "description": 'Penetration testing is a systematic process that goes beyond just identifying vulnerabilities. Ethical hackers engage in a comprehensive examination of an organization\'s security posture. This involves understanding the target system, conducting reconnaissance, exploiting vulnerabilities, escalating privileges, and maintaining persistence. The goal is not only to find weaknesses but also to simulate real-world cyberattacks. Pentesters often use a combination of automated tools and manual techniques to uncover complex vulnerabilities that might not be apparent through automated scans alone. The results of a penetration test provide actionable insights, allowing organizations to remediate vulnerabilities and improve their overall security strategy.'

    "title": "Virus: What are they?",
    "description": 'Computer viruses are a subset of malware designed to replicate and spread autonomously. They are capable of attaching themselves to executable files or embedding within other programs and documents. Viruses are often transmitted through infected email attachments, compromised websites, or removable storage devices. Once inside a system, a virus may execute malicious actions, such as destroying files, stealing data, or disrupting system operations. Viruses can be categorized based on their behavior, such as file infectors, macro viruses, or polymorphic viruses, each with its own unique characteristics. As technology has evolved, so have viruses, with modern security measures, including heuristic scanning and behavior analysis, being employed to detect and prevent their propagation.'

    "title": "SQL Injection: Basic Explanation",
    "description": 'SQL Injection is a sophisticated attack vector targeting the interaction between a web application and its database. When a web application does not properly validate or sanitize user inputs, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious SQL code into the queries executed by the database. This can lead to a range of malicious activities, including unauthorized access, data manipulation, and even complete database compromise. Blind SQL Injection occurs when the attacker can infer information without directly viewing the results. Advanced techniques, such as time-based blind SQL injection, involve making the database delay its response to extract information indirectly. Developers combat SQL Injection by using parameterized queries, input validation, and employing security mechanisms like web application firewalls (WAFs). Regular security assessments, including code reviews and penetration testing, are critical for identifying and mitigating SQL Injection vulnerabilities.'
